This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict credit default. It uses a dataset named Credit Default Dataset.csv, which contains financial and demographic information. The goal is to help financial institutions make better lending decisions by identifying individuals likely to default. The dataset includes features like Income, Age, Loan, and Loan to Income, with 'Default' being the target variable (1 for default, 0 for no default). The dataset comprises 2000 entries, with 1717 representing non-defaults and 283 representing defaults.

The chosen model for this prediction task is a Random Forest Classifier. This model is well-suited for the task because it's an ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees, which helps in improving accuracy and robustness, capturing non-linear relationships, and providing insights into feature importance while reducing the risk of overfitting.

The data is prepared by separating the features (Income, Age, Loan, Loan to Income) from the target variable (Default). It is then split into training and testing sets, with 70% of the data used for training and 30% for testing. This split ensures that the model is evaluated on unseen data, providing a more realistic assessment of its performance.

After training the Random Forest Classifier on the training data, the model makes predictions on the test set. The performance of the model is evaluated using several metrics: a classification report, accuracy score, and a confusion matrix. The results show an exceptionally high accuracy of approximately 1.00 (or 100%). The confusion matrix further details the model's performance, indicating that out of the test set, 508 non-defaults were correctly identified, 91 defaults were correctly identified, there were 0 false positives (non-defaults wrongly predicted as defaults), and only 1 false negative (a default wrongly predicted as a non-default). This indicates a very strong predictive capability of the model on this specific dataset.
